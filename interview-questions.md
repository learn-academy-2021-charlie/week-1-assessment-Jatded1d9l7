# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is an operation that you would like to run. You would use a function to express logic.

  Researched answer: A function is a set of instructions that specifically detail how to do a task. Functions make code reusable and can only be executed if it is called.


2. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  Your answer: An argument is a single point of logic while a parameter is the entire logic.

  Researched answer: Arguments are specified using parentheses. Additionally, arguments are the values that are passed through the function. On the other hand, parameters are initialized to the values of the arguments.  



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is a given location for a data point.

  Researched answer: An index is a read only property that contains the position of a expression within a string.  A value has a type, which can be a number, string or other type of data. To create a value, it's name must be called upon.  



4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: Built-in methods are functions that are built into the programming language and are used for common functions. These are pre-made functions.

  Researched answer: A method is a function that is a property of a method. A built in method is a preprogramed function that is commonly used.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: There is one driver and one person actually doing the coding. While pair programing there is only one working file being worked on. The navigators job is to direct the coder. While the coder is responsible for writing the code.

  Researched answer: Pair programing is when two programmers share a single work space. The programmer is the driver, while the other- who is giving the direction is the navigator.  



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: This week I found learning the terminal, terminal commands, git, and github helpful. Everything is so new to me, so learning all of this was mind blowing for me.
