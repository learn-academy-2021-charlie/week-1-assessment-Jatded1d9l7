# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is an operation that you would like to run. You would use a function to express logic.

  Researched answer: A function is a set of instructions that specifically detail how to do a task. Functions make code reusable and can only be executed if it is called.

// Review: Set of logic and rules that when given a specific input, will give a consistent output.
//- little code machines that we create and produce logic
//- they are self contained or encapsolated  
//- can be called and reused multiple times
//- the building blocks of any program

2. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  Your answer: An argument is a single point of logic while a parameter is the entire logic.

  Researched answer: Arguments are specified using parentheses. Additionally, arguments are the values that are passed through the function. On the other hand, parameters are initialized to the values of the arguments.  

//Review: the parameter is the placeholder. The argument is the actual value.
//- Argument has to have actual dataType
//- has to be a data type that JavaScript recognizes
//-

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is a given location for a data point.

  Researched answer: An index is a read only property that contains the position of a expression within a string.  A value has a type, which can be a number, string or other type of data. To create a value, it's name must be called upon.  

//Review: An index is a position of an element in an array or a position of a character in a string.  
//- index describes the location
//- index starts at zero, the first character or element starts at zero.
//- the value is the actual element or the character and the index is the position.
//-they are connected, they fall  closely inline with each other.


4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: Built-in methods are functions that are built into the programming language and are used for common functions. These are pre-made functions.

  Researched answer: A method is a function that is a property of a method. A built in method is a preprogramed function that is commonly used.


//Review function that is in place by the creators of JS. Functions that are used frequently.  
//- Some started in the language from the start but there are some that are being added all the time. Sometimes they are borrowed from other languages.
//- with every update build in methods are being added.
//- built in methods are designed to act on a particular data type.  
//- do a google search to see what method is used on a data type.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: There is one driver and one person actually doing the coding. While pair programing there is only one working file being worked on. The navigators job is to direct the coder. While the coder is responsible for writing the code.

  Researched answer: Pair programing is when two programmers share a single work space. The programmer is the driver, while the other- who is giving the direction is the navigator.  

//- one source code
//- driver is typing
//- navigator is contributors to the ideas and direction that the code is going.
//- should switch roles often.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: This week I found learning the terminal, terminal commands, git, and github helpful. Everything is so new to me, so learning all of this was mind blowing for me.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration: a piece of code over and over until a condition is met.
//- this is incredibly important in programing.
//- computers are really good at this.
//- humans are sloppy, computers are not.
//- we will spend a lot of time talking about this.
//- this concept is very abstract.

2. Higher Order Functions: functions that contains other functions or outputs of other functions.
//- function that takes another function.
//- nest functions
//- there are some built in functions

3. Jest: JS framework used for testing.
//-framework that can work with react. But it is JS focused....
//-JS testing framework
//- JS focused


4. Classes: blueprints for objects that consist of data and behavior.
//-data= variables- things that hold data dataTypes
//- behaviors functions

5. React: JS library for building user interfaces.
//using JS and putting it together in a different way
//-- allows JS to build logic and things we can see in the browser.
